## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository serves as the primary technical staging environment for the **Cybersecurity Foundations Intensive**. It is established to manage version-controlled documentation and lab configurations that reflect a rigorous **Purple Team** methodology—integrating defensive posture with offensive insight.

### 🧪 Core Learning Objectives
* **Network Defense:** Implementing robust firewalls and rule-based access controls.
* **Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring packet-level data with Wireshark to identify signature-based anomalies.
* **Security Automation:** Utilizing Python for rapid deployment of security tasks and log management.
* **Infrastructure Scaling:** Managing hybrid virtual environments via VMware, Termux, and GitHub Codespaces.

## 📝 Mission Statement & Methodology
The following lab milestones were executed using a **"Security-First"** approach, ensuring all configurations meet industry standards for hardening and resilience.

1. **Environment Staging:** Configured a virtualized laboratory environment utilizing an Ubuntu Server instance and Kali Linux nodes.
2. **Network Surveillance:** Deployed Wireshark to intercept and analyze local network traffic for potential lateral movement and intrusion vectors.
3. **Task Automation:** Developed custom Python scripts to automate system health telemetry and security log rotation.
4. **Validation & Audit:** Verified firewall integrity and user permissions to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
